Developed for the Hack Club Campfire Flagship event. Scripts written entirely in C#, powered by the Unity Engine.
Developer Thoughts (2/16):
Hi! This is definitely a work-in-progress right now. I wanted to have 10 games made within the 60 hours, but it will most likely be about 5.
I think the UI looks pretty bad at its current state, and I think the presentation could be way better for the games, but I have been creating
all version with building the minimum viable product and focusing on functionality rather than style. These games should theroetically be functional in their
current states.

All games were build with the intention of being variations of the original versions, as released.

My interpretation of Tennis For Two is directly inspired by East Coast's Interactive take on TFT, with slightly updated controls for keyboard usage and improved scoring.

My version of tetris is inspired by the 1984 version for the Electronica, with updated controls and scoring.

My version of Pac-Man is inspired by the original Namco Arcade cabinet version in 1980.

In the future, I plan on creating 2 more interpretation on classic 2D games, as well as improving the overall presentation of the game. This is my first (serious) unity game,
so don't critque it too hard please!
